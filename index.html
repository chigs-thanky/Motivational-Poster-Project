  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal Motivation Image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h3 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own Motivation Image into the Motivation Images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h3, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the Motivation Image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the Motivation Image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h3 uppercase with CSS.
